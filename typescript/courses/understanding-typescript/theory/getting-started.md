## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a JavaScript **superset**, that means that is an upgrade of the programming language JavaScript. It is also **a tool to help developers write better code**.

**It cannot be executed in a JavaScript environtment**, like browsers or node.js.

TypeScript **is compiled to JavaScript**. So you code with TypeScript, with its advantages and features, and you finally get a normal vanilla JavaScript code.

It also add **types** as a feature for JavaScript language, and a better error checking.
