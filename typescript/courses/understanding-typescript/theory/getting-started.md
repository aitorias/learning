# Getting started

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a JavaScript **superset**, that means that is an upgrade of the programming language JavaScript. It is also **a tool to help developers write better code**.

**It cannot be executed in a JavaScript environtment**, like browsers or node.js.

**Is compiled to JavaScript**, so you code with TypeScript, with its advantages and features, and you finally get a normal vanilla JavaScript code.

TypeScript adds:

-   **Types** as a feature for JavaScript language
-   **Interfaces** and **generics** (generic types)
-   Meta-Programming features, like **decorators**
-   Next-gen JavaScript features compiled down for older browsers
-   **Modern tooling to help even in non TypeScript projects**
-   Rich configuration options
-   **Better error checking**

## Differences with JavaScript

-   TypeScript is statically typed, and JavaScript is dynamically typed. That means that TypeScript types are checked and resolved in development and JavaScript during runtime.
